I don't know Rust, so I've decided to make a port of my [original](https://github.com/csixteen/py-bff) Python Brainfuck interpreter to Rust. I guess this sort of became my toy project for when I want to solidify some concepts while learning a new language. I've done the same for [Go](https://github.com/csixteen/go-bff) and I'll probably do the same for other languages.

I'm still pretty n00b in Rust and I'm currently still reading the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), which is pretty awesome btw. So apologies in advance if the code sucks. If you have any suggestions for improving the code, feel free to open a PR :D
